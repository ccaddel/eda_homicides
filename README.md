# Analyze A/B Test Results

In this project, I worked to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of conversions. My purpose is to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or maybe even run the experiment longer before making a decision.

## Workflow Setup

Create a Python environment in Jupyter Notebook with the following packages:
- pandas
- numpy
- random
- matplotlib.pyplot
- statsmodels.api
- scipy
- datetime
- and also `%matplotlib inline` and `random.seed(42)`
